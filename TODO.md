#### ‚ú® Feature Implementation

- [ ] Remove UI Kitten  
       _Refactor app to remove UI Kitten dependency and use styled-components for all styling._

#### üîÑ App‚ÄìBackend Consistency

- [ ] Unified API response fields  
       _Ensure Item schema includes both `playerId` and `collectableId` fields. Update all usages to expect and handle `id`/`playerId`/`collectableId` consistently, matching backend responses._
- [ ] Schema alignment  
       _Verify all components/readers use the updated schema consistently throughout the app._
- [ ] Profile fields sync  
       _Display and allow editing (where allowed) of new Player profile fields (bio, stats, etc.) added on the backend._
- [ ] Achievements sync

- [ ] Performance: Pagination  
       _Add pagination or infinite scroll for large lists._
- [ ] Error boundaries  
       _Add component-level error boundaries for resilient UI._

#### üìö Documentation & Dev Experience

- [ ] Update API documentation  
       _Docs must match new parameter names and response structures._
